# Installation

1. Copy these files into your OpenCart root directory
2. Copy Bitshares Checkout (https://github.com/sidhujag/bitsharescheckout) files into your OpenCart root directory, overwrite any existing files.

# Configuration

1. Fill out config.php with appropriate information and configure Bitshares Checkout
    - See the readme at https://github.com/sidhujag/bitsharescheckout
2. In the opencart administration under Extensions->Payments, click the "Install"
   link on the Bitshares row.
3. Also under Extensions->Payments, click the "Edit" link on the Bitshares row.
4. Set the status to enabled (this activates the bitshares payment extension and 
    enabled shoppers to select the bitshares payment method).


# Usage

When a shopping chooses the Bitshares payment method, they will be presented with an
order summary as the next step (prices are shown in whatever currency they've selected
for shopping).  They will be presented with a button called "Pay with Bitshares."  This
button takes the shopper to a Bitshares invoice by opening the Bitshares wallet.  Once payment is received, a link is presented to the 
shopper that will take them back to the order summary.
